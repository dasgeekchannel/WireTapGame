            You look around the room and notice the scalpel is just 
            within reach. Your arm moves towards it, but the pain shoots 
            through your arm like a thousand razers. Fighting through it
            your fingers manage to grab the metal handle of the blade. 
            The signals from your brain to your hand are in slow motion
            yet you manage to get it straight and into your fist tightly
            the sharp scalpel upright, ready to slash. Struggling you 
            start to pull it back towards you, carefully trying not to
            knock anything off the table. Just as you clear the tray
            the metal handle connects sending a loud 'ting'.

            Uzman sees you, he turns and comes rushing. His hand holding
            the syringe extended outwards. Suddenly Uzman slips on a pool 
            of blood. His shoes screech against the tile floors and he 
            crashes face first onto the surgical tray.
            The scalpel you were holding goes straight into his eye.
            Uzman's weight collapses the side table and you lose grip of
            the scalpel which gets shoved further into Uzmans head as his
            head smacks the floor.

            You start to panic and scream for help as loud as you can.
